I am a PhD student at Georgia Tech, advised by Prof. Alexey Tumanov, with research interests in systems for LLM serving.

Before joining Georgia Tech, I was a research intern at AMD, where I worked on optimizing concurrent computation and communication on AMD GPUs under the mentorship of Shaizeen Aga. I completed my Masterâ€™s in Data Science at UC San Diego, and prior to that, I worked for two years as a Machine Learning Engineer at Sahaj.ai.
