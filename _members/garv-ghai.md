Hi! I’m currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Science at Georgia Tech with a focus on Systems. I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at Manipal Institute of Technology in 2022. My academic interests include building efficient system architectures for large-scale ML workloads and exploring software–hardware co-design to push the limits of performance.
