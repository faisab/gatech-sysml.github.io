I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology, having completed my B.Tech in 2023 at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. My academic interests lie at the intersection of computing systems and machine learning, with an emphasis on designing and optimizing system architectures to enable scalability and efficiency in modern ML workloads.
