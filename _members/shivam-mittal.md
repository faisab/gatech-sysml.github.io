I earned my M.S. in Computer Science from Georgia Institute of Technology in May 2025, where I focused on research at the intersection of systems and machine learning. Prior to that, I worked at Microsoft Research on related areas, including SysML as well as search and recommendation systems. I received my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Ropar in 2019.

I'm passionate about building scalable systems that power AI infrastructure, distributed computing, and other real-world use cases.
