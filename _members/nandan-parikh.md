I am a first year MS CS student at Georgia Tech planning to specialize in ML. Most recently I was working at Flipkart as an SDE-2 on their travel search systems. During the course of my Master's degree I'll focus on better understanding Systems for ML and also building on my experience in Computer Vision. I graduated from BITS Pilani, India with a B.E. in CS.
