> "Letting GPUs sit idle should be punishable by law â€” my research makes them go brr ðŸš€"

Hi! I am a second year MS CS student at Georgia Tech specializing in Machine Learning. I am interested in the intersection of systems and DL -- making models more efficient and understanding GPU perf. bottlenecks. 

I worked as an AI Frameworks intern at the AMD quantization in Summer'25 and accelerated their quantization and evaluation pipelines using multi-gpu parallelism strategies. Prior to Georgia Tech, I was a research fellow at Microsoft Research India and worked on Project [Hyway](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/hyway/), where I built computer vision prototypes for indoor user localization and user-state understanding. I graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India majoring in Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering.
